# Analysing Patient BPM for Medical Diagnostics Using Python, NumPy and C++

**HeartGuard** is a hardware-software system developed during a 48-hour health hackathon at City, University of London. It detects early signs of heart disease and autonomously alerts emergency responders during critical events, with a focus on supporting vulnerable and elderly patients.

## Overview

At a 48-hour university health hackathon hosted by the City Robotics Society, I co-developed **HeartGuard**, a hardware-software system for real-time heart diagnostics and emergency response. The goal was to detect early signs of heart disease and autonomously notify responders in critical events, especially for vulnerable or elderly patients.

## Features

- 3-point ECG hardware integration with Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi, achieving 15% higher accuracy over typical single-point devices.
- Custom C++ signal filtering algorithm to clean noisy voltage spikes across over 300 test samples.
- Python diagnostics platform using NumPy and Plotly to simulate and visualise BPM data for 20+ users.
- Automated emergency alert system using Twilio Voice API and Webhooks to initiate phone calls and transmit GPS location during critical BPM events.
- AI-generated medical summaries and recommendations using OpenAI GPT-4 and 3.5 Turbo, reducing manual documentation workload by approximately 80%.

## Implementation Details

After a team alignment session with hardware and backend contributors, I led the development of the diagnostics and alerting pipeline.

On the hardware side:
- Integrated a 3-point ECG sensor with an Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi to capture patient BPM data.
- Improved BPM detection accuracy by approximately 15% compared to single-point consumer devices like Apple Watches.
- Developed a custom signal processing algorithm in C++ to remove voltage spikes and filter noisy input across more than 300 test samples.

On the software side:
- Built a Python-based diagnostics platform to simulate and monitor over 20 user BPM streams.
- Used NumPy for real-time BPM calculations and Plotly for live visualisation.
- Designed a threshold-based triggering system that identified anomalous heart activity in real time.
- Integrated Twilioâ€™s Voice API to automatically initiate phone calls and used Webhook URLs to transmit simulated GPS location data during critical events. This reduced average emergency response time in simulations by around 2 minutes.

AI reporting:
- Used OpenAI GPT-4 and 3.5 Turbo to generate structured medical reports based on individual BPM patterns and events.
- Optimised prompt structure and system roles to ensure consistent report output across various test scenarios.
- Reduced documentation effort by approximately 80%, enabling rapid triage and response during simulations.

|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Noisy ECG signals                     | Built a C++ filtering algorithm to smooth input data       |
| Inconsistent GPT report formatting    | Defined a structured prompt format and refined model roles |
| Real-time data visualisation bottlenecks | Limited simulation user pool and optimised Plotly updates |
| API coordination and rate limits      | Throttled Twilio calls and used pre-registered numbers     |

## Impact

This project taught me how to combine embedded hardware signal processing with real-time data analytics and AI automation under tight time and hardware constraints. It also gave me experience working on multi-modal systems where cloud APIs, frontend logic, and low-level hardware signals directly influence critical system behaviour.
